## BalloonPopping 

A game … there’s a countdown timer to start the game after to countdown.  
Move over the balloon constantly on the screen and just try to pop the balloon.  
Above there’s a text view showing the duration of the game and down at the bottom a text view showing the increasing score.   
Each time you pop the balloon in addition to all when the balloon pops there’s going to be a sound of the popping and a visual showing that the balloon popped and check this out.

You are able to turn off or on the popping sound of the balloon with the volume button in the menu.   
And after the game is over the result activity is going to open up and the result activity of course includes a text view that tells user what is your score, good job and all that.   
Also be able to see the score and the highest score.   
And if you want to play or quit the game use those buttons.
